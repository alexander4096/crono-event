# crono-event

I present to you my new program for the Linux community.

It's called:
Crono-Event
Version 1.0.0
It's written in Python 3.13 + PyQt6 and Nuitka for binary packaging.
Operating System: Linux (Debian 13.2 amd64)

It's designed for the Linux operating system.

With this program, you can accurately track event times, create alarms, see the time, and much more...

Who is this program for?

Content creators, professionals, teachers, students, coordinators, or anyone who needs to track the time of activities with set periods.

## Features: 

1) Countdown and countdown timer: allows you to track the duration of an activity with the option to adjust its start time.

2) Scheduled alarms with sound: alerts you when to start or finish an activity.

3) Event Tracking: We can accurately track time for activities, whether in class, working on assignments, giving presentations, or expositions. We also have a system for storing events if needed.

4) Break History: This is very useful when you need to mark when you finish an activity.

5) Time in Foreground: Displaying the time in the foreground is a useful way to track events in OBS or streaming.

6) Multilingual: This allows the community from different countries to use the program comfortably in their own language.
